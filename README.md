<h1 align="center">Bookshelf App</h1>
<p align="center">An app for searching books and getting details, mobile first.</p>
<p align="center">Project made with react, for FotonTech Frontend challenge.</p>

## Project

The project is not perfect, could have some more polishing trough [useReducer](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usereducer) or even a better
state lifintg tool, like [redux-toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/). </br></br>
In this project I tried a lot of concepts that I know, like lifting up state([Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html)), custom hooks, CSS-in-JS([styled-components](https://styled-components.com/)), 
even getting props trough styled-components to render a border based on focused state and added a spinner after API calling. </br>
It was a lot of work but a lot of fun.
