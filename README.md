<p align="center">An app for searching books and getting details, mobile first.</p>
<p align="center">Project made with react, for FotonTech Frontend challenge.</p>

## Project
In this project I tried a lot of concepts that I know, like lifting up state with [Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html), custom hooks, debouncing api calls, CSS-in-JS with [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/), 
even getting props through styled-components to render a border based on focus state and added a spinner after API calling. </br>
It was a lot of work but a lot of fun.

## Improvements and feedforward
During the development of this project, some improvement ideas have shown up, like having a better polishing through [useReducer](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usereducer) or even a better state lifting tool, like [redux-toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/).
